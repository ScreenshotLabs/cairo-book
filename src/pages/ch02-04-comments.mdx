# Comments

In Cairo programs, you can include explanatory text within the code using comments. To create a comment, use the // syntax, after which any text on the same line will be ignored by the compiler.

```rust
fn main() -> felt252 {
    // start of the function
    1 + 4 // return the sum of 1 and 4
}
```
